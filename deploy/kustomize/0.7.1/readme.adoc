## Install to a single namespace
Intall the RuntimeComponentOperator by running the command `kubectl apply -k base`
This will install the runtime component operator to the namespace `default`, and the
operator will watch for new RuntimeComponent instances only in the namespace default
To delete the operator, `kubectl delete -k base`

## Install to watch all namespaces
Example overlay files are provided for an installation to watch all namespaces. This
example overlay also changes the install namespace for the operator to `test-project`
and adds the necessary ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding
To install run `kubectl apply -k overlay/example`
To delete run `kubectl delete -k overlay/example`
