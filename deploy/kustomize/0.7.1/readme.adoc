# Install the operator using kustomize

The operator can be installed to watch either a single namespace or all namespaces
in the cluster. If watching all namespaces, then a ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding
are required. Resource files and kustomize overlays are provided for both, with some example
overlays to modify them

## Install to a single namespace
Intall the RuntimeComponentOperator by running the command `kubectl apply -k base`
This will install the runtime component operator to the namespace `default`, and the
operator will watch for new RuntimeComponent instances only in the namespace default
To delete the operator, `kubectl delete -k base`

## Install to a different namespace
The example overlay `test-namespace` can be used by running
`kubectl apply -k overlays/test-namespace`  
This will install the operator into a namespace called 'test-project' and watch for instances
being created in this namespace.

## Install to watch all namespaces
To install run `kubectl apply -k overlay/cluster-wide`  
This overlay adds the necessary ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding to allow the operator
to watch all namespaces. The operator itself will be installed to the namespace 'default'.  
To delete run `kubectl delete -k overlay/cluster-wide`

## Install to watch all namespaces into a different namespace
The example overlay `test-namespace-cluster-wide` builds on the `cluster-wide` overlay, and will
modify the namespace in which to install the operator. Use this overlay by running `kubectl apply -k overlays/test-namespace-cluster-wide`
