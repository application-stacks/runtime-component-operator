* amd64

OpenShift 4.6 or higher is supported. The operator is also supported on any cluster that has Kubernetes v1.19 or higher.

== Installation

=== Option 1: Install using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) on OpenShift

== Current Limitations

* Knative support is limited. Values specified for `.spec.autoscaling`, `.spec.resources` and `.spec.replicas` fields would not apply for Knative when enabled using `.spec.createKnativeService` field.
* Monitoring feature does not support integration with Knative Service. Prometheus Operator is required to use ServiceMonitor.
* After the initial deployment of `RuntimeComponent`, any changes to its labels would be applied only when one of the fields from `.spec` is updated.
