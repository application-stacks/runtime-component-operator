= Installing the Runtime Component Operator using kustomize

This directory contains kustomize files that can be used to install the operator
in your cluster in various different configurations, and also some example overlays
which show how the installation can be customized

== base
The simplest configuration will install the operator into the default namespace, and the operator
will watch for RuntimeComponent instances only in its own namespace. To install, run:
`kubectl apply -k base`
and to uninstall, run:
`kubectl delete -k base`

== examples/watch-own-namespace
This example overlay demonstrates how to modify the base configuration to install/watch a
namespace other than 'default'. The example installs the operator to a namespace called
'rco-ns' which should already exist. To install, run `kubectl apply -k examples/watch-own-namespace`

== overlays/watch-another-namespace
This overlay installs the operator into the namespace 'rco-ns', but configures it to
watch for RuntimeComponent instances in a different namespace called 'rco-watched-ns'. As
this overlay install resources into two different namespaces, the namespace must not be specified
in the kustomize.yaml file. To install, run `kubectl apply -k overlays/watch-another-namespace`


== examples/watch-another-namespace
This example overlay builds on the previous one, but demonstrates how to change the
install and watched namespaces. In this case, the operator is installed into 'rco-ns2'
and it will watch for resources in 'rco-watched-ns2'. To install run `kubectl apply -k
examples/watch-another-namespace`

== overlays/watch-all-namespaces
This overlay installs the operator into the default namespace, but configures it
to watch for RuntimeComponent instances in any namespace. Compared to the base,
this requires additional ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings. To install run:
`kubectl apply -k overlays/watch-all-namespaces`

== examples/watch-all-namespaces
This example overlay builds on the previous one, and demonstrates how to change
which namespace the operator is installed into. In this example, the operator
is installed into a namespace called 'rco-ns', and will still watch for
RuntimeComponent instances in any namespace. To install, run:
`kubectl apply -k examples/watch-all-namespaces`
